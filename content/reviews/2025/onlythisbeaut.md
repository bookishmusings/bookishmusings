# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5

love me some queer history. this is a book about being gay in countries and time periods where it's criminalized, and the persistence of existing as queer. it's also about finding communities and about belonging. most of all it's about queer joy. and i love it. this will stay with me the way Like a Love Story did.
