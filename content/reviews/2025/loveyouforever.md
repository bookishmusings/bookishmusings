# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5

a quick but expansive book/memoir about fandom, culture, and belonging. we learn so much about the history of korea and how korean culture came to be from a diasporic pov. we also learn about body dysmorphia and ED, mental health, sex and sexuality, religion, purity culture, and otherness. i rly like books like this, and the comparison to trick mirror was truly not an exaggeration. on the one hand, there's nothing you haven't heard before, and on the other, it needs to be said again.

*My thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for the audio ARC.*
