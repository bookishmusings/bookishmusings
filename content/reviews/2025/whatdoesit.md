# Title Details

📕 **Full Title**: What Does It Feel Like?
 \
🖊 **Author**: Sophie Kinsella

🔎 **Book Description**: What Does It Feel Like? is fiction, but it is my most autobiographical work to date. Eve’s story is my story. Why did I write such a personal book? I have always processed my life through writing. Hiding behind my fictional characters, I have always turned my own life into a narrative. It is my version of therapy, maybe. Writing is my happy place, and writing this book, although tough going at times, was immensely satisfying and therapeutic for me.
