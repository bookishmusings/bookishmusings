# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐⭐/5

3.5 stars rounded up.
this is a frightening book about eugenics and forced sterilization, which aren't all that far from where we are right now. it happened in the past and it happens in the present, and either way it's harrowing. that said, i wasn't super into the white savior narrative of it all, which i think started getting especially ingratiating somewhere in the middle of the book. i also wasn't super into jessa's domestic dramas- so many moments in time i truly couldn't see where her husband was entirely wrong. on the other hand, carrie buck's story was so much more interesting and i wish it was fleshed out more/given priority over jessa's life.

tldr; it started out great but started getting less great somewhere in the middle.
