# Book Review

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê/5

Our unnamed narrator holds a PhD in English, where she focuses on comparing different cultures' representations in film and literature on marriage and love. Two years since graduation, she hasn't landed a TT job yet (she's adjuncting, making about 8k a quarter). Anyway, so this hits a little too close to home. What I truly enjoyed about this book is how the narrator's voice is basically the same as mine. I don't mean it's relatable. I mean the most unrelatable thoughts I have about the world and my job somehow overlaps with this narrator. In this somehow narcissistic, self-enhancement-ish way, I think I truly enjoyed the book. I feel like the last sentence IS something the narrator would also say (but more eloquently).
I also truly enjoyed the phrase "Preity Zinta and the even prettier Saif Ali Khan" when she was talking about KHNH.
The choice of having the author narrate the book could have gone wrong in so many ways, but it didn't!!! The narration was also excellent.
What I didn't quite like is the ending. It was a bit abrupt for my tastes.
All I have to say is this book is immaculate and worth all the hype it's gotten so far and I can't wait to hear people's criticism about it (which I'll take personal offense to, maybe)
