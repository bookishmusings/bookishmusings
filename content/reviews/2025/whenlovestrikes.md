# Book Review

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê/5

my toxic trait is i believe i'll write a romance best seller if i actually sat down and tried. this book was a bit of a mythbuster in that regard, but trust, i'll lick my wounds and be right back with that delulu thought.

this is a primer for people who, i think, have never read romance or never interacted with romance readers. it talks about the main tropes, the routes to publishing (in this economy??) and other aspects of romance if you've never read a fanfic or a romance in your life. which is a bummer, i think, because there's so much else that i as a casual outsider would never know.
