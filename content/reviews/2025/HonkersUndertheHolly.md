# Book Review

⭐⭐/5

everything was just so sped up, i felt like i missed a chunk of the plot (but it just didn't exist?). fun and cute tho. i'll be thinking about the goose for a long time, even though i will not think about the rest of the book? i also didn't appreciate that the gay person was pushed back into the closet (also without ceremony)? like that was pretty unwarranted.

_thanks to netgalley and the publisher for an ARC._
