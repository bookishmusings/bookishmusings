# Book Review

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê/5

It's always difficult to review a short story collection, because there are some that I am naturally into/moved by and others not so much.

I was almost on the edge of tears at the end of the story of the art student going through a breakup and being chosen by a cat (and everything that happens to the cat), and a brother trying to get revenge on his brother's scammer. But for a few others, I just couldn't care enough. I was wondering why not- because it's not like those stories weren't good. I think it's because I've been reading too many similar books almost one after the other, and at this point, it's starting to be a bit repetitive. On the other hand, I bet if you've not read books about places people go to heal, you're going to love this one.

Eventually though, this book is about finding community in unexpected ways, unexpected places, and among unexpected people, which is always a nice thing to read about.
