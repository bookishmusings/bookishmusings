# Book Review

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê/5

This is such a great book- I was hooked from the beginning and was rooting for both protagonists till the very end. The narration was excellent, and even though I usually hate a big production in audiobooks, I was okay with this one because the other parts were so great! I devoured it (perf companion to data analysis and walks!)

Wow now I want to read more books like this!
