# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐⭐/5

i got extreme cabin fever reading this book. i don't know how people read this in 2020.
while a white family is vacationing, an older black couple comes to the estate claiming they own it, and there's a blackout in new york. i couldn't wait for the book to be done because the feelings of cabin fever was palpable and i just couldn't take it anymore.
