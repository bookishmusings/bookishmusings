# Title Details

üìï **Full Title**: Sunrise on the Reaping
\
üñä **Author**: Suzanne Collins

üîé **Book Description**: Sunrise on the Reaping will revisit the world of Panem twenty-four years before the events of The Hunger Games, starting on the morning of the reaping of the Fiftieth Hunger Games, also known as the Second Quarter Quell.
As the day dawns on the fiftieth annual Hunger Games, fear grips the districts of Panem. This year, in honor of the Quarter Quell, twice as many tributes will be taken from their homes. Back in District 12, Haymitch Abernathy is trying not to think too hard about his chances. All he cares about is making it through the day and being with the girl he loves. When Haymitch‚Äôs name is called, he can feel all his dreams break. He‚Äôs torn from his family and his love, shuttled to the Capitol with the three other District 12 tributes: a young friend who‚Äôs nearly a sister to him, a compulsive oddsmaker, and the most stuck-up girl in town. As the Games begin, Haymitch understands he‚Äôs been set up to fail. But there‚Äôs something in him that wants to fight . . . and have that fight reverberate far beyond the deadly arena.

# Book Review

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê/5

i sobbed for about 3 hours after finishing the book and transitioned straight to being very very angry. how is it that in 2012 when i first read this book, i was like "this is fiction, they don't murder children for entertainment in this world" and now that it's 2025, i am like, "wow. i was a naive child." haymitch doesn't get a second of respite in this book. but of course, this is more than just haymitch. this book is about what happens during "peacetime", the propoganda about the price we pay for not-war, and all the things, the people, we are never told about in history. i cannot believe they got children to murder each other for food/safety and "honor" and it's this sense of horror is somehow even more acute in this book. i cannot believe they [spoiler for the orginal trilogy: got the victors back to fight in the 75th hunger games ] the absolute cruelty of the capitol made me cry so many times, it's not even funny.
