# Book Review

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê/5

this is one of the best books i've read on the topic, i think. it's so balanced in its view (compared to so many others), and talks about the cog/neuro origins of ideology in terms of rigidity and inflexibility. it's a micro perspective that sells its idea very well, without going too much into the macro (which is kind of limiting, but that's the field in general).

i did think her writing was a bit cringe at first, but i think it does its job well. i liked the afterword, which gave me a very strong sense of "these are the thinkers i'm conversing with," which i feel like was a much better way to end a book than the usual "and this is what YOU can do about it." like, girl, i don't want to do anything about it. i'm done being an individual fighting the system, you know?
