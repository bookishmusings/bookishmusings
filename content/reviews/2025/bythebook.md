# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5

idk why i keep rereading this book but it truly scratches an itch in my head everytime. unfortunately, immediately after i finished re-reading this book, i found out that MY Adam Martinez/Frederick Wentworth is getting married to his girlfriend of NINE years and now i'm going to die a spinster. im okay, really. i need to have a crush on a woman to get over it though.
