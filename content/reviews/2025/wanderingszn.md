# Book Review

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê/5

this book seemed so promising, but ultimately was a letdown.
the MC was just straight up annoying with her woe-is-me and i'm-not-like-other-girls attitude towards everything. her sister and her best friend love fashion? i'm not like them. they have problematic attitudes towards food? couldn't be me. they all had unlimited money, but she thinks she is not like her sister (who lives in a one-bedroom apt in NYC thanks to the father's money), who feels no guilt to use her father's credit card. those passages really pissed me off, so it's not really women's fiction per se.
i also didn't really care for the romance sub-plot, which seemed forced.
the "visions" of her ancestors, though a very interesting plot point, just made no sense without context (why didn't other people question why she knew these things randomly?)
i did love the food descriptions, though. now i'm craving homemade vanilla and butter, oops.
