# Book Review

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê/5

idk what to think of this one. it's pretty fast paced and entertaining tho!!

this was also super not cliche, which is what i've been looking for in a romance book, which basically atp is like if you've read one you've read them all, sometimes. never did i know what was going to happen next, and yet nothing was super random/uncalled for.
