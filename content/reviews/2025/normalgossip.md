# Title Details

📕 **Full Title**: You Didn't Hear This From Me: (Mostly) True Notes on Gossip
 \
🖊 **Author**:  Kelsey McKinney

🔎 **Book Description**: From the host of the Normal Gossip podcast, a delightfully insightful exploration of our obsession with gossip that weaves together journalism, cultural criticism, and memoir.

n You Didn’t Hear This From Me, McKinney explores the murkiness of everyday storytelling. Why is gossip considered a sin, and how can we better recognize when it’s being weaponized? Why do we think we’re entitled to every detail of a celebrity’s personal life? And how do we define “gossip,” anyway? As much as the book aims to treat gossip as a subject worthy of rigor, it also hopes to capture the heart of gossiping: how enchanting and fun it can be to lean over and whisper something a little salacious into your friend’s ear.

# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐⭐/5

i had a blast reading this book. i think this is an early contender for a top ten reads this year for me, only because it's so entertaining and also super informative/well-researched. obviously, as a podcast host, the narration here is also excellent. no notes. i was sad that the book was over, which hasn't happened to me in a long time.

_Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for the ARC_
