# Book Review

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê/5

i remember that episode of mad men where [spoilers for mad men ahead, btw] betty goes to nevada to get a divorce, and never really understood the idea [end of mad men spoilers].

this book kind of picks it up from there, and really concentrates on the rights of (white, rich) women in the 1930s. our protagonist is otherwise headstrong and knows what she wants- she wants her career back and she wants a divorce for a ~secret~ reason that's very easy to infer. she meets a bunch of other women who also temporarily move to Reno for different reasons.

i really liked this book. it has this traditional angle where the protagonist has extremely good reasons to do all the things people in her circles don't. i think that was brave, even if i was a bit squeamish about her thoughts. it was well-written and fast paced, and kept me interested throughout.
