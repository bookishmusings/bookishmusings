# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐⭐/5

My very first reaction to this book was- “Has anyone told Nora Princiotti that she writes like she talks?” My second reaction was- “Damn the audiobook version would have been AMAZING!” but in my stupidity I didn’t realize this is an essay collection (I thought it would involve lots of pictures for no reason at all. It was picture-esque though.

This is a series of essays about women pop stars in the past 20ish years. It starts with the author placing herself in this pop culture landscape as a child (born into a family of concert hall capital M musicians) at a book fair buying a _Mateamorphosis_ CD. It immediately got me hooked (as a child who brought a CD of Gujarati songs at a book fair because I couldn’t find what I really wanted- a Hannah Montana CD). It ends with the author telling us how amazing it s to have newer pop stars reflecting the same cycle (musically not topically, thank god), how Good 4 U is very similar to Misery Business but only sonically and thankfully without the slut shaming.

Honestly this book doesn’t really tell you anything groundbreakingly new about the world, but it synthesizes so much information about the world in such a fun package that it’s absolutely a blast to read through.
