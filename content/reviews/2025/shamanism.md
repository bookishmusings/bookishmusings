# Book Review

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê/5

I was both frustrated and engaged while reading this book.
On the one hand, Singh deals with "otherness" and "orientalism" and "not scientific" with extreme care. As someone who gets frustrated while reading a lot of West-centric social sciences, this was a refreshing book where Singh shows the nuance that I don't see often. We have a lot to gain from understanding history and in understanding cultures from such a lens, I believe. Singh also does great when he's talking about how shamanistic practices (neo-shamanism) and some of the rituals are also practiced in the modern world.
On the other hand, I couldn't help but wonder WHO the audience of this book is - was it just men? Why are majority of the examples (not of the traditional shamans, who probably are majority men for all I know, but of the modern manifestations of these) about men? It's maddeningly bro-y.
