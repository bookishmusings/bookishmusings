# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐/5

I will always pick up books like this because the ideas of gaze and power interest me. I would have worshiped this book in my early twenti es. But having read a few books that addresses these topics, I'm not entirely sure what's new about this one. How does it separate itself from the tens of books that talks about power, sex, and gaze from sex work or adjacent perspectives? It's more slice of life than a thriller-ish book that I thought it was going to be from the blurb, but that's okay, it focused more on Baby/Ruth's everyday feelings and grief.

_Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for an audio ARC._
