# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐⭐/5

I got sucked in at the very beginning and couldn't stop listening to this book about two video game developers who hate each other, and then don't. I liked both the main characters, which is very rare for me, and I found myself rooting for both of them. Even as a non-gamer, this was a fun, engrossing read that was excellently narrated too.

_Thanks to Netgalley and the publisher for the ARC_
