# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐⭐/5

this is so shockingly hopeful and optimistic that a lot of the times, i was just like, wow, you can do that??? it felt like watching parks and rec for the first time (except parks and rec in 2025 seems a bit... dated for reasons i can't say)

it's funny and vulnerable and my heart fills with the true earnestness of the entire project. i hope the author always maintains it, no matter what. the absolute hopeful note of the last "note"/"chapter" made me very very emotional, and i just wish i had 1/4th of this overlook of the world and our society in my life.

*thanks to netgalley and the publisher for an audio ARC.*
