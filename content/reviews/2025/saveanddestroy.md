# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5

you know when you read a book and all you have to say for every word, every sentence is - 'yes, exactly!' because either a) you've already had the thought, b) you've had the thought but not in that exact way, or c) wow, you've never thought about it in this way? that's how i felt reading this book.

i really liked each essay/speech in this book. it's important and also, importantly, accessible. on the one hand, i really liked (or really disliked) how much i related to so many parts of the book, and on the other, i am disappointed that it needs to be said and then said again.

*thanks to netgalley and the publisher for the ARC.*
