# Book Review

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê/5

I had a lot of fun reading this book about a model who gets recruited to be a spy during the cold war. However, I don't think I'm going to think about this book again. While I was reading it, it was super interesting, but I didn't find myself wanting to read it while I wasn't actively reading. Also while reading it, sometimes I caught little online language which just kept putting me off. The narrator on the other hand was excellent!
