# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐⭐/5

love me an unlikable character filled with rage, and this one delivers on the unlikeable part and on the rage part. it also throws in an unreliable narrator with very little brain space for anything that's not self-hatred, so this was an absolute blast of a read. the main character hates themselves so much that they know very little about themselves (including their name!). all they know is they are an outlaw and outside the margins of all kinds of social constructs. just absolutely off-the-rails book that i'll be thinking about for a while.
