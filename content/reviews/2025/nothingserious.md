# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5

i think there's so much in this book that i simply cannot comprehend, and i'm so glad that i couldn't.
eddie is disillusioned working at a picture-sharing tech company in love with her multi-millionnaire and single-after-seven-years best friend. the best friend, while on the apps, is now implicated in the murder of one of his dates, a gender studies professor. now eddie has to grapple with all of that, because she's obsessed with both the professor and the best friend.
the musings in this book about gender, dating, tech, money, and "usefulness" is just infuriating because society simply shouldn't be like that. it's super fast paced, and i couldn't stop reading it. it's dark but somehow funny (in a scoff way, not in a haha way). i'll be thinking about this a lot.
i don't know what it says about me that i have read a long list of books about disillusioned tech workers who also are women.
