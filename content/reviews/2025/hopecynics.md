# Title Details

📕 **Full Title**: Hope for Cynics: The Surprising Science of Human Goodness \
🖊 **Author**: Jamil Zaki

🔎 **Book Description**: For thousands of years, people have argued about whether humanity is selfish or generous, cruel or kind. But recently, our answers have changed.  In 1972, half of Americans agreed that most people can be trusted; by 2018, only a third did. Different generations, genders, religions, and political parties can’t seem to agree on much, but they all think human virtue is evaporating. Cynicism is an understandable response to injustice and inequality. But in many cases, it is misplaced.  .

# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5

I've always liked Dr. Zaki's work, and this one was also similarly great. We read so much work on beliefs and politics, and this one is about approaching life with hope, which has an emotional case, obviously, and a palliative one. Now we know there are rational reasons to be hopeful about life and everything else. This made me want to be more hopeful for my own health.
