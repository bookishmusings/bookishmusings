# Book Review

⭐⭐/5

i was super excited about this book. each of the sisters was so unlikable that i couldn't even process the rest of the plot!!! the cat psychic was funny i guess, but a lot of the book just felt like i was reading about those tiktok preteens obsessed with drunk elephant (or the videos adults make of preteens). maybe i missed the point, but like, thanks for telling me how to have an ED i guess?
