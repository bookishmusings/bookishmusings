# Title Details

üìï **Full Title**: Sucker Punch: Essays
 \
üñä **Author**:  Scaachi Koul

üîé **Book Description**: Sucker Punch is about what happens when the life you thought you‚Äôd be living radically changes course, everything you thought you knew about the world and yourself has tilted on its axis, and you have to start forging a new path forward. Scaachi employs her biting wit to interrogate her previous belief that fighting is the most effective tool for progress. She examines the fights she‚Äôs had‚Äîwith her parents, her ex-husband, her friends, online strangers, and herself‚Äîall in an attempt to understand when a fight is worth having, and when it's better to walk away.

# Book Review

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê/5

this is truly a sucker punch of a book. i have read scaachi koul's writing for a long time, but have never read her book (it's been on my want-to-read list since who knows when).

when i went into this book, i didn't know what to expect, other than who the author was. this book read like how i experienced taylor swift's ttpd, strangely. i don't know how to explain it, but it was maddening in a very good way. it's awful the things people experience in public life.

she talks about body image and disordered eating, terrible and/or painful relationships with people we love (including ourselves), and just her sense of self (which somehow felt like my sense of self?) in absolute honest and raw ways. overall, i did not have fun with this book (as i expected i would), but it was a great book, that i would think a lot about.
