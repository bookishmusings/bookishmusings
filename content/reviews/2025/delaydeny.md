# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐⭐/5

my reasons for reading this book are the same as everyone else's, i guess, but there's something extremely maddenning to realize that the only respite is to lawyer up. but it's also infuriating that insurance companies say you shouldn't? anyway, i was pissed throughout.

since this is a new audiobook, i would have appreciated an author's note of sorts at the beginning or at the end talking about how things have changed since the book's publication 15 years ago (2010 was 15 years ago? let's open up that coffin, yikes).

i must add that the audiobook narration was top-notch!
