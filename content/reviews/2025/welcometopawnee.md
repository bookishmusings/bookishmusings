# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐/5

a good time was had. i got nostalgic enough to be tempted to watch parks and rec again (I won't because i'm not paying $80 to peacock or whatever, i'll just watch clips on youtube or something).

BUT, and i never thought i'd say this about anything: this book should have stayed a podcast.
