# Book Details
(from the author's website)

**MUSIC, LYRICS, AND LIFE is the songwriting class you always wish you’d taken, taught by the professor you always wish you’d had. With humor and empathy, acclaimed singer-songwriter Mike Errico examines both the mystery of songwriting and the logistics of life as a songwriter. For years, this set of tools, prompts, and ideas has inspired students on campuses including Yale, Wesleyan, and New York University’s Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music.**

# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5

i read this with a lot of interest with the idea that it could be applicable to any form of writing with a structure and this book didn't disappoint. i might buy a paperback of this to keep reminding myself of what a process is- that the final version exists because the authors revised the earlier not-so-great-drafts over and over and over again, and that we need to go through a thousand bad ideas to maybe find a good one in there somewhere. excellent book, even if you are not a songwriter, but might want to write lots (collaboratively or alone).
