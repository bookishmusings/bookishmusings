# Book Details
(from Goodreads)

**Libby Lost and Found is a book for people who don't know who they are without the books they love. It's about the stories we tell ourselves and the chapters of our lives we regret. Most importantly, it's about the endings we write for ourselves.**

# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐/5

I thought the premise for the book was very interesting, and at parts, I really liked the book. I've never read a book like this. The characters were very interesting too, but the story seems a bit far-fetched. Overall, I felt there was something lacking- somehow I couldn't really get into it, and when I put it down, I didn't really want to pick it up.
