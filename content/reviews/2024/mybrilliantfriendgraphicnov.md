# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐/5

i think reading my brilliant friend by elena ferrante shaped me as a person - i remember so much of the books even though i read it over seven years back. 

i still often think about lila and lenu and any elena ferrante book is an instant yes for my tbr. 

HOWEVER, this was a pretty bad adaptation, according to me. it takes the meat off the books and kind of focuses on the basics of the plot, which really makes you question why the characters are doing what they're doing. i think it's also made jarring by the excellent TV adaptation, which I've been watching and obsessing over.

the illustrations were pretty good though, but it just makes no sense. not even a little bit about Maestra Oliveira, no sense of the absolute violence that lila faces at home, the incessant stalking of marcello, and then romanticizing of stefano, the murder of don achille and the taking away of pasquale's father- all such important elements of the plot of the book that drives the story forward are all missing from the book.


i'm not sure what the purpose of this adaptation is.
