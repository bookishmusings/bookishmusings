# Book Review

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê/5

This was such an interesting premise and an excellent execution. I don't think I've ever read a historical fiction set in Tipu Sultan's Mysore, which is crazy to me- because I was such a fan when i was in, like, middle school. 

However, I wasn't a fan of the audiobook narrator, whose narration included an unwarranted urgency and intensity, which I found very irritating.
