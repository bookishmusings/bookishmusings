# Book Review

⭐⭐/5

This book is a sweet, lighthearted rom-com that makes for an easy, feel-good read. I liked its pacing, which also allowed to reveal the characters’ misunderstandings and the small confusions that keep them from getting together right away.

However, while the setup is enjoyable (which is why I wanted to read it!), the book didn’t quite leave a strong impression on me. I thought the characters lack depth or I just didn't connect with them, and I struggled to feel truly invested in their journeys. I don't think the book is too memorable either. I don't think it was meant to be any of these things, so if you're looking for a light and fluffy book, this one is it!

Overall, it’s a fun, light read, but unfortunately not one that will stick with me for long.
