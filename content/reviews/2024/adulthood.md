# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5


I've been feeling emo about growing up on some kind of safe-haven-stupid-and-silly internet of late (which is why this website exists in its current form), and reading this book made me realize how far away we are from that. 

Anyway, adulthood indeed _is_ a gift, and i LOVE watching others grow up and change their minds because of life. I've been following Sarah Andersen and her comics for a long, long time- since it was basically a blog back in the day, and reading this and about her growth as an artist and a person was kind of emotional- like how you realise you and your friends grew up together? 

I read this while being unable to move after a concert, so the body-dying parts were especially hilarious.
