# Book Review

‚≠ê‚≠ê/5

my review on goodreads got deleted because people discoursed on twt and review-bombed this book. i got like 25 likes on goodreads because people thought i was also discoursing, but i was not. being a small, small part of stan twt drama is how the last day of my 20s went, which is very typical of me (my worst nightmare, i swear!) 

it was ok.

I've been a huge lurker of Sarah's tumblr/website. If Sarah has no fans I'm dead etc. However, this book was so not it for me. I think the biggest issue was that the pictures don't match the text at all- so it's more of an editing issue. There would be descriptions of clothes/shoes with no accompanying pictures, which confused me to no end. Maybe this book is not meant to be an ebook and only meant to read as a physical book? Second, fashion commentary (which I loved on her blog as a person with no sense of fashion) was heavily overshadowed by a sort of unofficial life commentary. This made me wonder who the book was for- a casual fan? a person in fashion? I don't know, but I wanted more of the former.
