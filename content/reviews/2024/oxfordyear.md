# Book Review

⭐⭐/5


If you are an audiobook lover like me, chances are you've _read_ Julia Whelan before. I have always been a fan of Julia Whelan's narration and usually pick up a book if it's got her as a narrator. 

So, unsurprisingly, I was excited to pick up what I thought would be a typical romance book (a la, let's say Emily Henry or TJR). However, this was NOT that. This was SO sad. I've read enough of sad fiction in my life to definitively say that I am not a fan of books like this. It's hard for me to explain what I mean by that without giving away spoilers, so I won't. However, trust me, I HATE giving a bad review to a Julia Whelan book. BUT this is essentially me saying, if I knew the actual plot, I wouldn't have picked it up, and not necessarily that it was a bad book. 

I was a bit enthralled, but confused the premise of a postgraduate student working remotely on a political campaign, while also going through all the events in the book. She might have been really smart and great with utilizing her time wisely, but my goodness? I would love to have a little of what she has in terms of efficiency!
