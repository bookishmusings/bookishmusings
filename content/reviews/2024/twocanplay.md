# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐⭐/5


I started hate-reading Ali Hazelwood after _The Love Hypothesis_, because I couldn't stand the tiny-FMC-with-an-eating-disorder and big-MMC-who-stays-away-from-her-for-reasons trope, as well as the extremely problematic power dynamics between the two main characters, that she had going on for so many of her early books. However, I've been really enjoying her later books because I think she really took all the criticisms about this specific trope and some of the power dynamics issue, and sort of stepped away from that being the biggest focus of her books. At the same time, it's the exact same plot as the other books, just a different font, if you will-which is good, because I know exactly what to expect so there's literally no let down. I'm definitely not reading the genre end of genre-fiction for mind-blowing prose or plot, you know?

Basically, I think this is my second-favorite from AH (my fav being _Love, Theoretically_). This one has all the yearning that I love in a good romance book- like YES, make them pine for each other for my listening pleasure, please! However, I did feel that the resolution was a bit too quick-I felt like I missed something with how fast it came about. However, this is a top-tier mind-numbing romance!!!
