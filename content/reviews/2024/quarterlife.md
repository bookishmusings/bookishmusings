# Book Details
(from the publisher)

**India's literary novel of the year—an enthralling, award-winning debut from a "blazingly original voice"** (Vauhini Vara).

In the fashion of the big novels by Salman Rushdie or Amitav Ghosh (Biblio), Quarterlife is a groundbreaking portrait of a nation on the cusp of a new age. When the Bharat Party comes to power after a divisive election, Naren, a jaded Wall Street consultant, is lured home to Mumbai. With him is Amanda, a restless New Englander eager to embody her ideals through a teaching fellowship in a Muslim-majority slum. Meanwhile, Naren's charismatic brother Rohit, an amateur filmmaker, sets out to explore his roots and befriends the fiery young men of the Hindu nationalist machine. Their journeys lead them into an astonishing milieu of brutal debates and infatuations as fraught as they are addictive, feeding into a festive night when all of Mumbai is on the streets—where the simmering unrest erupts. Hailed as "a landmark novel" (Indian Express), Quarterlife is a brilliantly innovative work that tests the limits of what the novel can achieve.

# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5

When I read literary fiction with a political flavor, I try to imagine the environment and the fears and anxieties of the protagonists. This step was very easy in Quarterlife, because it felt like a book about the people around me in India. It is set in the familiar bylanes of Bombay and Pune and Konkan, the people talk like the people I know, and the anxieties, though unfounded and hate-filled are all-too-familiar. This is a strange feeling to have when reading a book- it hits eerily close to home. I couldn't tell real life and fiction separate at times. 

It's a testament to the author's sharp pen to be able to explain the context in which the characters function so well. I wanted to cry and scoff and stay angry. The talking points of the protagonists and the party were so infuriating (in a very good way!). I will be thinking about this book for a long time to come.
