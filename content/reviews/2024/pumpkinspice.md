# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐⭐/5


i love, love a romance, even though i haven't read anything good of late. this book changed all that. i love fall, i love cafes, i love walkable communities, and i have definitely definitely thought about giving it all up and opening a book store/cafe (who hasn't), even though i don't know much about running a business and am too optimistic about ideas to let realistic decisions as a business owner looking for (reasonable) profits.

all that said, i really liked this book. this is such a cozy autumnal book- just no thoughts, no real conflict, cushion-your-brain fun, a walkable small-town with a community feel- everything that seems oh so cozy and perfect. (have i ever swiped right on a person cuz they had "farmer" in their bio? oh yes i have!!!) just comforting cheesy cliche!
