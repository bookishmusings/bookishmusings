# Book Review

‚≠ê‚≠ê/5

It started off so good, I was sure it was going to be a 5-star read. However, as it went on, it started dragging. I wasn't sure why the main characters couldn't get together/stay apart (there are valid reasons for both) halfway through the book. The conflict wasn't because one of them didn't show up for the other when their dad died, but because... what? There are also literally no communication issues and everyone gets what they want, which is fine, but then why did it go on for this long?

I was so excited for a childhood-best-friends/second-chance romance involving sapphic celebrities/influencer, but alas.
