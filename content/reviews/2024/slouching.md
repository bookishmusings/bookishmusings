# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5

This audiobook is fantastic—Maya Hawke’s narration truly brings it to life. In her interviews, Hawke has mentioned that in narrating this, she wants younger readers to connect with this collection, and I think this audiobook is a perfect way to make that happen. I’m so grateful I got to a chance to review this advance copy!

I’ve been a Joan Didion fan since I first read the essay *On Keeping a Notebook* years ago (back then, I’d only read that essay, not the whole collection). Now, after living in Southern California, I’ve either visited many of the places Didion describes, or know of the lore. I could hardly believe the original book was written nearly 80 years ago—it feels as fresh and relevant today as ever!
