# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐/5

For context, I am an Indian person living in SoCal. 

My only problem with this book (and it is a pretty big one!) is that this is just basic Indian cooking 101? The ingredients aren't all that mind-blowing either. Like this is exactly how I'd cook it in India. There are so many shortcuts to cooking Indian food outside India that I would absolutely not cook it the way the author says I would. Plus, a lot of the "pantry staples" rely on Indian stores in the US. Not saying that there's a wrong way to cook, obviously, I'm just confused as to what about this is focusing on the diaspora. So, maybe I'm not the target audience then?
