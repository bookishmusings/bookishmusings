# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5

goddamn???

i don’t think i’ve ever been this amazed and uncomfortable at the same time while reading a book. it's kind of like being online—exposing (ha!) the worst of humanity in the most grotesque and hilarious ways. relentlessly self-serving; hiding behind fluent jargon, enough to get out of all the consequences of our terrible actions. and that last chapter put me over the edge. absolutely outrageous

never a dull moment in this short story collection- i think this is probably a top 5 read of the year for me!
