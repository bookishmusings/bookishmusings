# Book Review

‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê/5

Haven't met a book by Adiba Jaigirdar I didn't like! It's always an easy 4 stars at least, and this one is too!

Here's what I had a problem with though - it was so tech-utopia-ish that I think will date it. It already sours me a bit. I think the characters acknowledge this too, and their growth arcs past the book would probably reflect that.

It's also basically a sapphic version of _When Dimple Met Rishi_ by Sandhya Menon. I'm neutral about this, sort of, except of course this is better in my books because Dimple and Rishi annoyed me to no end and I loved both Rani and Meghna.

All this to say, desi sapphics stay winning. It's giving Tina and Anjali ditching Rahul to have a chill life together (the ending we all demand!).
