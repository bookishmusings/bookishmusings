# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐⭐/5

this was such a hilarious book in the most mind-numbing driven sort of way. i think it's for fans of ali hazelwood. 

i haven't read a good fake relationship book in so long- this is for you if you used to stay up way past midnight on school nights in high school and college reading fanfiction (in the best possible way!)

this is also a sports romance. i haven't read a sports romance in a few years, and i'm so glad i picked this one up- i really liked it!

you will have no choice but to swoon for the most part. except there's a revenge porn plot - not by the MMC, by the way, and also a lot of fatphobia, so trigger warning for that! 

the author says straightup that this is escapism fiction and it so is, like i said. i picked it up on a day i was desperately sad and needed to cling on to something silly for my sanity and this book came to my rescue!
