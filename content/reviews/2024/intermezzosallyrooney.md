# Book Review

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐/5

i'm an unabashed sally rooney fangirl, have been since at least 2016, and yet i could never tell you why. there's just something about her writing that pulls me in directions i never want to be pulled.

life was horrible when i was reading this book, and so it took me forever to get through it. i bought it the momement it released on audible (usually i wait for a library copy, but i just couldn't wait) and i finished on october 30. so i read it slowly over a month. it takes me so little time usually to finish a book, especially an audiobook, that i had to sit with my feelings a bit after i finished.

it's classic rooney, but i couldn't sell you on what this book was about, except that i hated being in peter and ivan's heads. i don't want to be in men's heads this much, please stop. like, i know that if it's a woman's POV, we would have gotten so much more social information about the other characters and we would have known so much about what they're thinking, but the voice of these two idiot brothers are so infuriating to be in.

BUT, that's craft, you know? i was blown away by how real these two felt (even though i hated it so much)- like actually two men telling me their stupid thoughts, or like listening to a two-men podcast. 

you could tell how different the two of them are by the way the chapters are structured. great exploration of masculinity (and power and relationships and everything else sally rooney does so well). like how could she write this, she's never been in a space where it's just men (any space where she's in, it's not just men)?

so even though the characters infuriated me, that is exactly the point, and it is so so good.
