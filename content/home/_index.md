# Hello ðŸ‘‹

**Welcome to my book blog!**

I've stylized my website following digital gardens. A digital garden is like a personal wiki and a knowledge database of thoughts and ideas. This website is a digital garden of my bookish thoughts and ideas.

I've been very dissatisfied with social media of late, and I was eager to post things in a place on the internet **that's completely and fully mine**. So when I decided to do a blog, even though initially I went the traditional routes, I was very dissatisfied. I decided- why not create a website? This way there are no pesky ads (for you!) and no rapidly changing needs and priorities of other brands (for me!) I'm so glad my full-time work lets me learn a little bit of coding- enough to create my little space on the internet. 

Welcome to my digital garden! ðŸŒ± I'm so glad to have you here!

**In the spirit of transparency, here are more details about the theme**:
