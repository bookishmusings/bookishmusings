today's round up is thanks to Netgalley and the publishers. here are six new/upcoming books i'm excited about. 




ðŸ“š **Toxic Striving**, Why Hustle and Wellness Culture Are Leaving Us Anxious, Stressed, and Burned Outâ€•and How to Break Free
by Paula Freedman-Diamond, PsyD

ðŸ“° **book description**: In this groundbreaking book, clinical psychologist Paula Freedman offers a clear path to help you move beyond toxic striving and instead turn inward for guidance. Using a combination of evidence-based tools and strategies grounded in acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) and intuitive eating, you'll gain the insight needed to reconnect with your true values, reclaim your physical and mental health, develop unwavering self-compassion and confidence, and live by your own rules.

*pub date: Dec 24 2024*

âœ¨  **book review**:  An excellent book about the lies we tell ourselves about how to survive in this world, with some nice exercises to help identify them. I absolutely loved the little vignettes used to explain some concepts and how they might show up in unexpected ways. The book itself is digestible and easy to understand. Came for the bitching about hustle and wellness culture, stayed for the takes on self-judgement.



ðŸ“š **The Rival**: by Emma Lord
(Narrated by Jesse Vilinsky)


ðŸ“° **book description**: Rivals-to-lovers gets an academic send-up in this charming and irresistible romantic comedy from Emma Lord, New York Times bestselling author.

*pub date: Jan 21 2025*

âœ¨ **book review**: emma lord's books are always so wholesome and full of friendships and low-stakes romantic drama. the inevitable miscommunication between all the characters are very understandable, mainly because they are 18. in this one, we have two academic rivals (but secretly childhood besties) trying out to get a staff writing position at their college magazine, while the college is trying to cut out funding for a bunch of student programs. the college admin drama is pretty funny (not in a hahah way) and realistic and frustrating. the audio narration was also excellent!


ðŸ“š **Out of Your Mind**:The Biggest Mysteries of the Human Brain,
by Jorge Cham; Dwayne Godwin

ðŸ“° **book description**: From the creator of WE HAVE NO IDEA, an introductory journey into your own mindâ€”if your inner voice had a Ph.D. in brain science, cracked jokes, and drew cartoons.


*pub date: Jan 28 2025*

âœ¨ **book review**: i had a lot of fun reading this book as a person in an adjacent field. sort of like a look-at-the-forest-not-the-trees approach. i think it's very accessible to basically anyone with a passing interest in psychology/human behavior/neuroscience. i've also been a huge fan of jorge cham's comics for the longest time, so this was such a treat!
what i didn't like though was reading this on an iPad (the netgalley iPad app). the comics/drawings were SO pixelated, i felt like i needed an eye exam. the other text was okay and so i know it's the editing of the book that's the problem. this issue was also super visible on the laptop, unfortunately, which kind of ruined my enjoyment of the book a bit.



ðŸ“š **Yeonnam-Dongâ€™s Smiley Laundromat**: Kim Jiyun, Narrated by Winson Ting, Translated by Shanna Tan


ðŸ“° **book description**: Situated at the heart of a rapidly gentrifying district of Seoul, the Yeonnam-dong Smiley Laundromat is a place where the extraordinary stories of ordinary residents unfold. It is already a haven of tranquility and reflection for locals, but when someone leaves a notebook behind, the laundromat becomes a place that brings people together. One by one, customers start jotting down candid diary entries, opening their hearts and inviting acts of kindness from neighbors who were once just faces in the crowd.

âœ¨ **book review**:  It's always difficult to review a short story collection, because there are some that I am naturally into/moved by and others not so much.
I was almost on the edge of tears at the end of the story of the art student going through a breakup and being chosen by a cat (and everything that happens to the cat), and a brother trying to get revenge on his brother's scammer. But for a few others, I just couldn't care enough. I was wondering why not- because it's not like those stories weren't good. I think it's because I've been reading too many similar books almost one after the other, and at this point, it's starting to be a bit repetitive. On the other hand, I bet if you've not read books about places people go to heal, you're going to love this one.
Eventually though, this book is about finding community in unexpected ways, unexpected places, and among unexpected people, which is always a nice thing to read about.

ðŸ“š **Single Player** by Tara Tai, Narrated by Natalie Naudus


ðŸ“° **book description**: Two video game creators go head-to-head in this delightful, queer enemies-to-lovers workplace romance debut, perfect for fans of T.J. Alexander and Helen Hoang.

*pub date: Jan 07 2025*


âœ¨ **book review**: I got sucked in at the very beginning and couldn't stop listening to this book about two video game developers who hate each other, and then don't. I liked both the main characters, which is very rare for me, and I found myself rooting for both of them. Even as a non-gamer, this was a fun, engrossing read that was excellently narrated too.

ðŸ“š **The Kennedy Girl** by Julia Bryan Thomas, Narrated by Ri Paige


ðŸ“° **book description**: This American Girl in Paris might hold the fate of nations . . . It's the 1960s, and the fashion culture of New York, Paris, and Milan is starting to make an impression on the mid-century American woman. Jackie Kennedy's effortless style leads the nation, although Mia's bustling bakery job doesn't often give her the time or money to craft a stylish closet after her idol in the White House. But when a mysterious stranger suddenly offers her a modeling job in Paris at the esteemed House of Rousseau, she takes a chance on it, despite knowing nothing about the world of fashion. As an orphan with big dreams, holding a one-way plane ticket to Paris, she sets off for what she hopes is a better life. But the job of a model runs deeper than photoshoots and runway walks, and as Mia adjusts to the Parisienne lifestyle, she realizes that not everything is as it seems. Becoming more and more successful in her position as an up-and-coming model, she is soon drawn into the Cold War by the very fashion house she works for. And as she finds herself falling further into national crimes and politics, Mia will soon have to decide which side of history she's really on.

*pub date: Jan 14 2025*


âœ¨ **book review**: I had a lot of fun reading this book about a model who gets recruited to be a spy during the cold war. However, I don't think I'm going to think about this book again. While I was reading it, it was super interesting, but I didn't find myself wanting to read it while I wasn't actively reading. Also while reading it, sometimes I caught little online language which just kept putting me off. The narrator on the other hand was excellent!
