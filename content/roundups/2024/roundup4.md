📚 **You'll Never Believe Me**, A Life of Lies, Second Tries, and Things I Should Only Tell My Therapist by Kari Ferrell

📰 **book description**: Before Anna Delvey, before the Tinder Swindler, there was Kari Ferrell, the hipster grifter.

*pub date: Jan 07, 2025*

✨  **book review**: I had no clue who Kari Ferrell was going into this, but I had a total blast! I picked up the book because it mentioned Anna Delvey, and I’m a sucker for some good grifter true crime. That said, most of the victims in the story are just regular folks or friends—not the rich targets I was expecting. Plus, the book doesn’t dive much into Kari’s “hipster grifter” days like I thought it would.
However, Kari does get into some interesting stuff, like being adopted as a person of color in a mostly white, religious town, and she also talks about some issues with the prison system. I really appreciated reading about her journey of self-discovery while dealing with bigotry.
This audiobook is brutally honest, with sharp wit, a tongue that could cut glass, and a charm that’ll steal both your heart and your wallet. Every chapter just got more unhinged in the best way, and the narration was top-notch. I couldn’t put it down, even though life did get in the way.



📚 **Lights On**: How Understanding Consciousness Helps Us Understand the Universe, by Annaka Harris


📰 **book description**: As accessible as it is awe-inspiring, this exclusive audio documentary by New York Times bestselling author Annaka Harris explores the unknown corners of consciousness and the cosmos.


*pub date: Mar 18, 2025*

✨ **book review**: I was listening in on a seminar back in undergrad and someone was giving a talk about the science of consciousness, and it totally had me intrigued, which is why I picked this book up. The audio narration for this was just excellent. I felt like I was having a conversation with someone who patiently explained all the science to me, an absolute novice. It felt like a podcast, which in my book, is great. I've never heard of an audio documentary before this and I think I'm excited to try more after this!


📚 **Rani Choudhury Must Die**, by Adiba Jaigirdar

*pub date: Nov 12, 2024*

📰 **book description**: In this sapphic dual POV romance by Adiba Jaigirdar, Meghna and Rani (ex-best-friends-turned-rivals) realize they're dating the same guy, so they team up to beat and expose him at a big science competition!

📚 **Statistically Speaking**: A Novel, by Debbie Johnson

*pub date: Dec 03, 2024*

📰 **book description**: As a high school history teacher, Gemma Jones loves the certainty of the past--specific names, solid dates, proven statistics. Maybe that's because her own past resembles a jumbled-up sock drawer, one where it's impossible to find a match. On paper, Gemma's life is just like any other successful, single thirtysomething. Her students adore her. She lives in a cute beachside cottage next door to the world's sweetest neighbor, Margie. And she's definitely caught the eye of Karim, the resident hot PE teacher at her school. But every day of her life, she can't get one thing out of her mind: the baby she gave up for adoption when Gemma was just sixteen years old. 


✨ **book review**:  Ti was really excited to read a women's fiction book that focused on adoption, as it’s a topic i’ve never explored in fiction before. i’m so glad it didn’t disappoint! The narration was also beautifully done and i found myself choking up from time to time. the main character's fears and anxieties seemed palpable and her emotional journey kept me invested to the very end.

📚 **Slouching Towards Bethlehem: Essays**, by Joan Didion

*pub date: Nov 05, 2024*

📰 **book description**: This program is read by actor and singer-songwriter Maya Hawke, star of Netflix's Stranger Things. Celebrated, iconic, and indispensable, Joan Didion’s first work of nonfiction, Slouching Towards Bethlehem, is considered a watershed moment in American writing. First published in 1968, the collection was critically praised as one of the “best prose written in this country.”


✨ **book review**: IThis audiobook is fantastic—Maya Hawke’s narration truly brings it to life. In her interviews, Hawke has mentioned that in narrating this, she wants younger readers to connect with this collection, and I think this audiobook is a perfect way to make that happen. I’m so grateful I got to a chance to review this advance copy!

I’ve been a Joan Didion fan since I first read On Keeping a Notebook years ago (back then, I’d only read that essay, not the whole collection). Now, after living in Southern California, I’ve either visited many of the places Didion describes, or know of the lore. I could hardly believe the original book was written nearly 80 years ago—it feels as fresh and relevant today as ever.
