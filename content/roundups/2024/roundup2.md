***welcome to this segment of my website, where i highlight authors, audiobook narrators, translators, etc.*** 

i recently read (and reviewed) a book written by julia wheelan, which reminded me how much i absolutely enjoy her as an audiobook narrator. i think she truly elevates any material and just makes listening to audiobooks such an immersive experience. she has narrated over 600 audiobooks to date. obviously i haven't read 'em all. however, here are 5 books that she narrated that i absolutely loved!  

📚 **Thank You For Listening**, by Julia Whelan

📰 **book description**: The story of a former actress turned successful audiobook narrator—who has lost sight of her dreams after a tragic accident—and her journey of self-discovery, love, and acceptance when she agrees to narrate one last romance novel. (isn't it meta)


✨ **book review**:  when i think about this book (i read it in  march, 2023), i think about the long spring walks i used to go on in SoCal. i was still learning to love a new place. i love a rom-com with epistolary elements and so remember finishing this book looking at some pretty spring flowers on my long weekend walk. 


📚 **My Year of Rest and Relaxation**, by Ottessa Moshfegh


📰 **book description**: A novel about a young woman’s efforts to duck the ills of the world by embarking on an extended hibernation with the help of one of the worst psychiatrists in the annals of literature and the battery of medicines she prescribes.


✨ **book review**:  i read this book in september 2020 and left this review on my goodreads: 
> This book is just *chef's kiss*
That last line just blew my mind ❤️

i don't need to remind you what 2020 was- a fever dream of a year where we were inside the whole time. an extended hibernation in my childhood bedroom, where my favorite children's author had just exposed how transphobic she was and my favorite singer had released and made me cry with her latest album. of course, i loved this book way too much, i'm just a girl in the world. 


📚 **The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo**, by Taylor Jenkins Reid


📰 **book description**: Aging and reclusive Hollywood movie icon Evelyn Hugo is finally ready to tell the truth about her glamorous and scandalous life. But when she chooses unknown magazine reporter Monique Grant for the job, no one is more astounded than Monique herself. Why her? Why now?


✨ **book review**:  I don't even know how many times i've devoured this book. i love me a sad gay women. add a historical element to it, and it's my fav. i know people cite this book as one of those anti-intellectual tiktok book, but i don't see it at all- like what are y'all talking about? ur just homophobic!!!


📚 **Chemistry**, by Weike Wang


📰 **book description**: A luminous coming-of-age novel about a young female scientist who must recalibrate her life when her academic career goes off track.


✨ **book review**:  i read this book in 2017, and i'm so due a re-read because my academic career is also going off-track oops. anyway, i've been thinking about this book over and over since i first read it. it's kind of the anti-coming-of-age, where the character kind of has everything together at the beginning and then her life keeps coming apart slowly. 

📚 **One True Loves**, by Taylor Jenkins Reid


📰 **book description**: In her twenties, Emma Blair marries her high school sweetheart, Jesse. They build a life for themselves, far away from the expectations of their parents and the people of their hometown in Massachusetts. They travel the world together, living life to the fullest and seizing every opportunity for adventure. On their first wedding anniversary, Jesse is on a helicopter over the Pacific when it goes missing. Just like that, Jesse is gone forever.Emma quits her job and moves home in an effort to put her life back together. Years later, now in her thirties, Emma runs into an old friend, Sam, and finds herself falling in love again. When Emma and Sam get engaged, it feels like Emma’s second chance at happiness. That is, until Jesse is found.


✨ **book review**: I first read this book in august 2021, after i had the biggest heartbreak of my actual adult life till then. i don't know why i read the book and was like yeah, that's a good idea, but i did. i was so much in pain already, why did i think this was a good idea? anyway, i remember crying so much and cursing at the ceiling and falling sick, oops. 


not to do the millennial thing, but *have you read any of these books? which julia wheelan book is your favorite?*
