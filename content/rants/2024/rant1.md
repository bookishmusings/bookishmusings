*This is the section of my blog where you'll find my hot takes that I allowed to cool.*

Friends, here's the thing. I always vote for the underdog in all categories so they have a fighting chance. I shouldn't have this time. 

Here are my thoughts:

# 1. Readers' Favorite Fiction

🏆 Winner: The Wedding People, by Alison Espach

🟢 My status: Yet to read

🙇‍♀️ My choice: Margo's Got Money Troubles, by Rufi Thorpe.

📚 Other Books I've Read in the category: Martyr!, by Kaveh Akbar, Intermezzo, by Sally Rooney, Greta & Vladin, by Rebecca Reilly

💬 Rant incoming!

I haven't read the book, so I obviously don't have thoughts about the book itself, but I'm so surprised _Intermezzo_ didn't! The internet's darling Sally Rooney was everywhere this summer and then even more everywhere this fall. I was depressed when it actually came out, and so had to wait a month before I actually read it, but absolutely adored it. My review for it at the time was:

> 4.5, will be 5
life was horrible when i was reading this book, and so it took me forever to get through it. 
it's classic rooney, but i couldn't tell u what this book was about, except that i hated being in peter and ivan's heads. i don't want to be in men's heads this much, please stop. like i know that if it's a woman's POV, we would have gotten so much more social information about the other characters and we would have known so much about what they're thinking, but the voice of these two idiot brothers are so infuriating to be in. 
BUT, that's craft, you know? i was blown away by how real these two felt (even though i hated it so much). you could tell how different the two of them are by the way the chapters are structured. great exploration of masculinity (and power and relationships and everything else sally rooney does so well). like how could she write this, she's never been in a space where it's just men (any space where she's in, it's not just men)?   

I didn't care much for _Martyr!_. At that time, I didn't even write a review, because I wasn't sure what to take away from it.

I was intrigued by two things about _Greta & Vladin_ : 1) queer siblings, 2) New Zealand. But I was bored by this book, unfortunately. That's literally all I said about the book at the time too:
>despite the very interesting synopsis, i was just bored throughout. 

_Margo's Got Money Trouble_ was my choice of the year. I often thought about this book much longer after I was done reading this book. I'd never read a book quite like this before and even though I tried, haven't since. This is what I wrote at the time:
>The synopsis and the chatter I've heard about this book did not prepare me for how wildly stressful actually reading this book was. Every single page, and every single decision that the main character (Margo) makes is absolutely wild, and also something I bet all of us would make at her age.
It's an excellent book about circumstances and choices and the illusion that we have options, when we often don't. 

# Historical Fiction

🏆 Winner: The Women, by Kristin Hannah 

🟢 My status: Read!

🙇‍♀️ My choice: The Lion Women of Tehran, by Marjan Kamali.

I'm not a huge fan of historical fiction, typically, unless it's historical romance, so I haven't read too many in 2024.

My thoughts about _The Women_:
> The third star is just for Julia Wheelan, by the way.
I kept thinking this book will get better (plot-wise), because why else is Julia Wheelan narrating it? But it doesn't. The characters are so unidimensional and people kept coming back from the dead.
The writing is super persuasive though. It got me feeling bad for the protagonist and all the people in the book. Also super weird/frustrating reading it in the current political context.

My thoughts about _The Lion Women of Tehran_:
>i'm in awe. this is the second book i read in nov that talks about saddam hussein and i absolutely did not remember who that is, even though the name had negative connotations in my mind. strange.

>anyway, when i first saw the comparison to my brilliant friend in the description, i was skeptical and thought they were exaggerating. but they truly weren’t. both beautifully explores the complexities of enduring friendship in the face of immense external "pressures" and politics. i truly loved every moment of this book. some people are so brave
